This document tracked a stabilization backlog that has now been triaged.

- Issues #30–#54 were either completed (CI items) or closed as **not planned** to keep the backlog focused on problems that are actually happening.
- If you want to revive any item, reopen the corresponding GitHub issue and re-add it here with fresh evidence/acceptance criteria.
